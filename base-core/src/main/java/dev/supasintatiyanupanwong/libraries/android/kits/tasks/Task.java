/**
 * Represents an asynchronous operation.
 *
 * <p/><h2>Handling task results</h2>
 *
 * <p>To be notified when the task succeeds, attach an {@code OnSuccessListener}:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * task.addOnSuccessListener(new OnSuccessListener&lt;Result&gt;() {
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     public void onSuccess(Result result) {
 *         // Task completed successfully
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * });
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>To be notified when the task fails, attach an {@code OnFailureListener}:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * task.addOnFailureListener(new OnFailureListener() {
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     public void onFailure(@NonNull Exception exception) {
 *         // Task failed with an exception
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * });
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p>To handle success and failure in the same listener, attach an {@code OnCompleteListener}:
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * task.addOnCompleteListener(new OnCompleteListener&lt;Result&gt;() {
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     public void onSuccess(Result result) {
 *         if (task.isSuccessful()) {
 *             // Task completed successfully
 *             Result result = task.getResult();
 *         } else {
 *             // Task failed with an exception
 *             Exception exception = task.getException();
 *         }
 *     }
 * });
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p/><h2>Threading</h2>
 *
 * <p>Listeners attached to a thread are run on the application main (UI) thread by default. When
 * attaching a listener, you can also specify an {@code Executor} that is used to schedule
 * listeners.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * // Create a new ThreadPoolExecutor with 2 threads for each processor on the
 * // device and a 60 second keep-alive time.
 * int numCores = Runtime.getRuntime().availableProcessors();
 * ThreadPoolExecutor executor = new ThreadPoolExecutor(numCores * 2, numCores * 2,
 *         60L, TimeUnit.SECONDS, new LinkedBlockingQueue&lt;Runnable&gt;());
 *
 * task.addOnCompleteListener(executor, new OnCompleteListener&lt;Result&gt;() {
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     public void onComplete(@NonNull Task&lt;Result&gt; task) {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * });
 * </code></pre>
 *
 * <p/><h2>Activity-scoped listeners</h2>
 *
 * <p>If you are listening for task results in an {@code Activity}, you may want to add
 * activity-scoped listeners to the task. These listeners are removed during the onStop method of
 * your Activity so that your listeners are not called when the Activity is no longer visible.
 *
 * <pre><code>
 * Activity activity = MainActivity.this;
 * task.addOnCompleteListener(activity, new OnCompleteListener&lt;Result&gt;() {
 *    {@literal @}Override
 *     public void onComplete(@NonNull Task&lt;Result&gt; task) {
 *         // ...
 *     }
 * });
 * </code></pre>
